# <img src="https://media.tenor.com/5Rc2tZprYfsAAAAi/rubber-duck.gif" width="60">  C/Shell - Piscine 42 Porto 

## Description

This project was developed as part of the *Piscine* at 42 Porto, one of the best software development schools in the world. 42 is recognized for its disruptive pedagogical model, based on a **peer-to-peer**, **project-based**, and **gamified** learning system. Founded in Paris in 2013, 42 is now present in over 40 cities, offering free programming education to anyone over the age of 17, regardless of prior coding experience.

### What is the Piscine?

The *Piscine* is a **26-day intensive bootcamp**, running from Monday to Sunday, designed to let participants experience 42's learning model and determine if it's the right fit for them. The *Piscine* is notoriously challenging and requires full-time dedication, making it difficult to balance with other commitments. On average, students who successfully complete the *Piscine* dedicate between **10 to 14 hours per day** to the program.

## About 42's Pedagogical Model

At 42, learning is **peer-to-peer**, meaning there are no traditional teachers. Instead, students work together to solve problems, share knowledge, and help each other overcome challenges. This method helps develop skills such as:
- **Critical Thinking**
- **Teamwork**
- **Communication**

Additionally, projects are evaluated by other students based on predefined criteria, promoting a continuous exchange of knowledge and critical reflection.
